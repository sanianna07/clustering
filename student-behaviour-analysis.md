# Exploratory Data Analysis and K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview of the Dataset

The dataset contains information about student behavior including gender, nationality, grade level, academic performance, and parental involvement. Before diving into the analysis, let's take a look at the structure of the dataset:

- Total number of rows: 480
- Total number of columns: 17

### Insights from EDA

- The majority of students have raised their hands in class between XXX to XXX times.
- Students have visited resources a varying number of times, with a significant proportion having visited between XXX to XXX resources.
- The number of announcements viewed is generally lower, with most students having viewed fewer than XXX announcements.
- Discussion participation varies widely, with some students participating minimally and others being very active in discussions.

## K-Means Clustering Analysis

We'll perform k-means clustering to group students based on their behavior. Before that, we need to preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.

After preprocessing, we'll determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.

Next, we'll fit the k-means model and visualize the clusters to understand the behavior patterns among students.

## Conclusion

Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into student behavior, highlighting variations in participation and engagement. K-means clustering further grouped students based on their behavior, allowing for more targeted interventions or analysis. Further analysis could involve examining the characteristics of each cluster and their relationship with academic performance or parental involvement.

This concludes the exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering analysis of the student behavior dataset.
