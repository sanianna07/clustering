# Exploratory Data Analysis and K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview of the Dataset

The dataset contains information about student behavior including gender, nationality, grade level, academic performance, and parental involvement. Before diving into the analysis, let's take a look at the structure of the dataset:

- Total number of rows: 480
- Total number of columns: 17

### Dataset Summary

The dataset comprises several features related to student behavior, including demographic information (gender, nationality, place of birth), academic details (stage, grade, section, topic, semester), engagement metrics (raised hands, visited resources, announcements view, discussion), parental engagement (parent answering survey, parent school satisfaction), absence records (student absence days), and class performance (class).

To proceed with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and k-means clustering, we start by summarizing the dataset's statistical properties, checking for missing values, and analyzing the distributions of numerical and categorical features. This approach helps identify patterns, outliers, and the data's structure, providing insights into how to approach the k-means clustering

The dataset consists of 480 entries with no missing values across all features. A brief summary of the numerical features includes:

- **Raised Hands**: Mean ~ 46.78, Min 0, Max 100, Std Dev 30.78
- **Visited Resources**: Mean ~ 54.80, Min 0, Max 99
- **Announcements View**: Mean ~ 37.92, Min 0, Max 98
- **Discussion**: Mean ~ 43.28, Min 1, Max 99

### Categorical Data Distributions

- **Gender**: Balanced distribution between male (M) and female (F) students.
- **Nationality and Place of Birth**: Wide range including Kuwait, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, among others.
- **StageID**: Includes lower level, middle school, and high school.
- **GradeID**: Ranges from G-02 to G-12.
- **SectionID**: Distributed across sections A, B, and C.
- **Topic**: Subjects include IT, Math, Arabic, Science, English, etc.
- **Semester**: Covers both the first (F) and second (S) semesters.
- **Relation**: Indicates the main respondent for the survey (mother/father).
- **ParentAnsweringSurvey**: Yes/No responses.
- **ParentschoolSatisfaction**: Satisfaction levels (Good/Bad).
- **StudentAbsenceDays**: Categorized as "Under-7" or "Above-7" days.
- **Class**: Performance categories labeled as Low (L), Middle (M), and High (H).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Numerical Features Distribution Insights:

- **Raised Hands**: The distribution shows a bimodal pattern, suggesting two distinct groups of students based on classroom participation.
- **Visited Resources**: Distribution is somewhat bimodal, indicating varying levels of engagement with resources.
- **Announcements View**: Skewed towards lower frequencies, suggesting that many students do not regularly check announcements.
- **Discussion**: More uniform across the range but shows a slight skew towards lower engagement levels.

#### Preparing for K-Means Clustering

Given the varied scales of the numerical features, standardizing the data is crucial before clustering to ensure each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations. We will explore the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and perform k-means clustering on the standardized data.


### Insights from EDA

- The majority of students have raised their hands in class between XXX to XXX times.
- Students have visited resources a varying number of times, with a significant proportion having visited between XXX to XXX resources.
- The number of announcements viewed is generally lower, with most students having viewed fewer than XXX announcements.
- Discussion participation varies widely, with some students participating minimally and others being very active in discussions.

## K-Means Clustering Analysis

We'll perform k-means clustering to group students based on their behavior. Before that, we need to preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.

After preprocessing, we'll determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.

Next, we'll fit the k-means model and visualize the clusters to understand the behavior patterns among students.

## Conclusion

Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into student behavior, highlighting variations in participation and engagement. K-means clustering further grouped students based on their behavior, allowing for more targeted interventions or analysis. Further analysis could involve examining the characteristics of each cluster and their relationship with academic performance or parental involvement.

This dataset's exploratory analysis reveals significant variability in student engagement metrics, suggesting potential for clustering to identify patterns or groups of similar student behaviors. The next steps involve k-means clustering to segment the student population based on engagement levels, further analyzed to derive actionable insights.
This concludes the exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering analysis of the student behavior dataset..
